## **PASS😶**
 
난 깨달았다

바람이다.

If you just waitI can't

To those who are waiting

The wind is even stronger

It's just a rush

It's windy

It means to get through it

No matter who goes out and falls

It means to fight a game.

삶에서

There's nothing but wind

My walk

The whole road is a wind road.

## **important🧐**

- you have to change `example.html` to `content.html`

- If you don't know where to put, then use `ctrl` + `f` => check
